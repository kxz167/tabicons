<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Welcome to Tabicons: the fully web sided tab organizer! This simple application is meant to help organize those unwieldly 25+ tabs-in-one-window panic searching us coders tend to do.</p>
<p>The mix of Microsoft Edge's integration of vertical tabs with Google's Material Icons, gives endless possibilites for organization through tab favicons.</p>
<h2>Use:</h2>
<h3>Icon Browsing:</h3>
<p>At the current time, there is no browse feature built into the website. Instead, please navigate to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons" target="_blank">https://fonts.google.com/icons</a>. Here, you will be able to browse all of the icons offered. Additionally, only one style (filled) is supported at the current time.</p>
<p>On that site at the top, you can search for icons. The "category" drop down will determine the first part of the url, and the name determines the second.</p>
<p>So the icon under category "image" with name "Add A Photo" can be translated as "/image/add_a_photo"</p>
<h3>Icon Page:</h3>
<p>You can go ahead and modify the URL yourself, or I have gone ahead and provided the following simple form to take you directly there.</p>
<form id="icon-form" [formGroup]="iconForm" (submit)="submit()">
    <input id="category" type="text" formControlName="category" placeholder="Category"/>
    <input id="name" type="text" formControlName="name" placeholder="Name"/>
    <button type="submit">Go!</button>
</form>
<p>Once the icon has been opened, it can be modified with the two sliders in order to change the colors. After any color changes, you will have to update the URL. Otherwise, each navigation to the URL will provide default black or white icons depending on the browser theme.</p> 
<h3>Saving:</h3>
<p>Once the URLs have been saved, navigation back to this website and that URL will show the exact same icon. In this way, the icons can be bookmarked or favorited in various page collections maintaining organization.</p>
