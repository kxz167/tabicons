# Tabicons

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.1.

I'm sorry about the short readme! My mind is mushy...

## Branches:
All work for the project was completed on master. This includes the typescript files for all icon handling, as well as the assets.

gh-pages is an automatically generated branch that hosts the github pages for the public facing sites and also includes all of the assets as well as the compiled single page application.

## Written Code:
The bulk of the written code is going to be under `src/app/icon-display`. Given that this was an auto generated Angular project, there are a good amount of generated files I did not touch. For other styling, it was distributed throughout global and component specific CSS files.
